## 🏛️ Project Architecture: The "Harish Rawat" Model
ToolVerse is not just a website; it is a **Distributed Edge Intelligence Hub**. The architecture is designed to solve the "Privacy vs. Power" dilemma by moving heavy data processing from the cloud to the user's browser.

### **The 3-Layer Logic Stack**
1.  **Orchestration Layer (React 19)**: A high-performance, lazy-loaded UI that manages routing, state persistence (on refresh), and the "Command Side-Bar" navigation.
2.  **Binary Execution Layer (WebAssembly)**: Local C++/Rust engines (FFmpeg, PDF-Lib, Tesseract) perform 100% private file processing with zero upload.
3.  **Neural Network Layer (Gemini 3.0 Pro)**: Advanced AI agents handle creative and complex logical tasks via secure Edge Isolates.

## 🚀 Systematic Workflow
The user journey is optimized for **Speed (< 15s Load)** and **Retention**:
*   **Discovery**: User lands on the Home Page (Top 20 Nodes displayed for speed).
*   **Navigation**: 3-Dot Menu (Left) -> Category Selection -> Tool Specific Node.
*   **Execution**: Data input -> Local/Neural processing -> Master Output.
*   **Rewarding**: Logic feedback (Ratings/Comments) -> XP Gain -> Reward Hub Access.
*   **Persistence**: URL-based routing ensures the page never blanks on refresh.
